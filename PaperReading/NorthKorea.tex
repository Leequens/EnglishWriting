Recently, There are two big news boomed in North Korea, one is that North Korea will not conduct any nuclear test and launch of intercontinental missiles and abolish  North Korea¡¯s nuclear site.Tthe other is that North Korea will concentrate all its efforts on economic development and improve people¡¯s living standards, which shows that North Korea officially announced the reform and opening up. This is not only the gospel of the Korean people, but also the gospel of the people in Northeast China.

In the past five years, the economic growth in the northeast of China, especially in the southeast of Liaoning, has been ranked last in the country. Dandong, which is the closest to North Korea and has been hailed as ¡°the largest and most beautiful border city in China¡±, has only 5000 yuan per square meter. Especially at the end of 2016, when the crisis of North Korea¡¯s nuclear tests intensified, prices in some districts in Dandong fell to less than 1,000 yuan per square meter. North Korea has followed the same path as China used to develop nuclear weapons first, and then vigorously develop the economy. With money, the missiles will be upgraded again.

Similarly, North Korea that has just announced the reform and opening up must have many business opportunities,. The size of North Korea is so small and going to North Korea to make a estate business will surely make money. Electronic information and manufacturing will certainly have good prospects. When I say a digression, I sincerely do not want the reunification between North Korea and South Korea. Otherwise, the South Korea¡¯s threat to accentuate Southeast Asia after it separated from the United States with nuclear weapons.
