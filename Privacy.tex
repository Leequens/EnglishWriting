\title{Privacy}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

It has become hotter and hotter for Facebook to reveal privacy. In the era of big data, it seems to be a open secret to leak user's privacy in the information companies. 

At the China Development High-Level Forum on March 26, Li Yanhong, CEO of Baidu, said that Chinese people are willing to exchange privacy for convenience and they enjoy this very much. What? Uh, I think I may be a fake Chinese, the logic of an overbearing president is really overbearing. These just like parents tell us they are for us after we found that they peeked our diary at childhood. Now, these APP , such as shopping, taxi and takeaway, become our "parents" which peep our chat history, camera and address book and tell us that they do this is to make us be more convenient. For example, If you search for what to do for arm pain in Baidu you will find that lots of APP recommend to you orthopaedic hospital.

Of course, being in the era of big data still benefits our users. It's OK to see the diaries of the "babies", because we have no way to select. As long as these "parents" do not read out and sell the diaries, those babies will be extremely excited.
